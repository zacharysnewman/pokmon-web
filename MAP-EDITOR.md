# MAP-EDITOR.md — Level Editor

## Overview

A browser-based tile editor overlaid on the game canvas, accessible via `?editor=true`. Supports designing, saving, loading, and play-testing custom dot-maze levels. All changes are auto-saved and levels can be stored in a persistent in-browser library.

---

## Accessing the Editor

```
http://localhost:PORT/?editor=true
```

On load the editor restores the last auto-saved session. If no autosave exists it starts from the built-in Classic level.

---

## Features

### What a tile can hold

A level is three independent layers. Within a layer, one thing per tile — the
layers never mix.

| Layer | Contents | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Tiles** (`tiles[y][x]`) | Wall, Empty, Dot, Power, Ghost door | Exactly one value per tile. Painting replaces what was there. |
| **Zones** (coordinate lists) | Red zone, Slow tile | At most one zone per tile. Painting one displaces the other. |
| **Objects** (coordinates) | Player, 4 ghost starts, fruit, 4 scatter targets | One object per tile. A drop onto an occupied tile is refused. |

Zones and objects sit *on top of* a tile, so a dot can be a red zone, and a
ghost can start on a slow tile — the built-in level itself puts two of its four
red zones on dot tiles. What cannot happen is two of the same layer on one tile.

An object on a half-tile (`x.5`) straddles two columns and holds both, which is
how it is drawn and how collisions are judged.

Clicking an object always picks it up, even while holding another one — with one
object to a tile, a click there could never have been a placement, so the editor
says which object it grabbed instead.

### The tile set (budgets)

Every placeable thing has a budget, so a custom map can be held to the same
stock as the main map instead of drifting into something unplayable. Budgets
are an **editor-side constraint only** — the saved JSON, the level format and
the game logic are untouched.

| Tile set | Dots | Power | Ghost doors | Red zones | Slow tiles | Walls / Empty |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Classic** (default) | 240 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 12 | ∞ |
| **Extended** | 360 | 8 | 4 | 8 | 24 | ∞ |
| **Sandbox** | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ |

- Classic's numbers are read from the built-in map at startup, so they cannot
  drift out of sync with it.
- A budget of `-1` (`INFINITE`, shown as `∞`) means unlimited.
- The **Tile set** section shows a live `used / budget` bar per kind, and each
  palette entry shows how many are left.
- Painting past a budget is refused and explains itself in a toast; erasing
  hands the budget back. Flood fill places as many as the budget allows.
- The tile set is remembered per person (`editor_prefs`) and stored alongside
  library entries, so re-opening a map restores the set it was authored under.
- Validation reports anything over budget — e.g. after importing a level built
  under a roomier set.

### Objects — one of each

Spawns and scatter targets are single movable objects, not paintable tiles.
There is exactly one of each and it can never be duplicated or deleted:

| Object | What it is |
|---|---|
| **P Player** | Where the player starts each life |
| **R / C / H / O** | The four ghost starting points |
| **F Fruit** | Where bonus fruit appears |
| **✕ ×4** | Each ghost's scatter-mode corner target |

With the **✥ Move objects** tool you drag any of them straight on the maze.
Clicking an object in the **Objects** list arms it — the next tap on the maze
places it — and arrow keys nudge the armed object one tile at a time. The list
shows each object's live coordinates. **Drop on half-tile** places on `x.5`
(the Classic player and red ghost sit on half-tiles).

The ghost-house gate is a **tile** now (budget 2 in Classic), painted like any
other. The level's `enemyHouseDoor` coordinate is kept in sync automatically,
so the saved JSON is unchanged.

### Tile Painting

| Tool | How to use | Key |
|---|---|---|
| **Paint** | Click/drag the canvas to place the selected tile | `B` |
| **Erase** | Click/drag to set tiles to Empty | `E` |
| **Flood Fill** | Click any tile to BFS-fill all contiguous matching tiles | `F` |
| **Move objects** | Drag spawns and scatter targets | `M` |
| **Red zone** | Click/drag to toggle junctions where ghosts can't turn up | `R` |
| **Slow tiles** | Click/drag to toggle tiles where enemies crawl | `S` |
| **Tunnel row** | Click any tile — its row becomes the warp tunnel row | `T` |

**Slow tiles** are the warp-tunnel mouths, where enemies move at a crawl. They
are per-tile, like red zones: paint them anywhere, in any shape, not just on the
tunnel row. The built-in level marks the same twelve tiles the old
`tunnelSlowColMax` / `tunnelSlowColMin` column bounds described (row 17, columns
0–5 and 22–27), so the game plays exactly as before. Levels saved with the old
column fields are converted on load.

Tile types in the palette:

| Swatch | Value | Meaning | Key |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wall | `0` | Solid — players and enemies cannot pass | `1` |
| Empty | `5` | Open corridor, no collectible | `2` |
| Dot  | `3` | Small pellet — counts toward level clear | `3` |
| Power | `4` | Power pellet — triggers frightened mode | `4` |
| Ghost Door | `2` | Ghost-house gate — only entering/exiting ghosts pass | `5` |

**Brush size** paints 1×1, 2×2 or 3×3 at once (`[` and `]`).

### Mirror painting

Symmetric mazes take a quarter of the clicks. `X` cycles the modes; the mirrored
axes are drawn on the canvas as dashed guides, and the hover preview shows every
tile a stroke will touch.

| Mode | Also paints |
|---|---|
| **· Off** | nothing else |
| **⇔ L/R** | the matching column on the other side |
| **⇕ T/B** | the matching row on the other side |
| **⤢ Diag** | the tile opposite through the centre |
| **⊞ All 4** | all four quadrants at once |

The grid is 28 × 36 — not square — so a corner-to-corner diagonal reflection has
nowhere to land; **Diag** mirrors through the centre point (a 180° rotation),
which is the diagonal symmetry a rectangular maze can hold. Mirroring applies to
red-zone toggling too, and every mirrored tile draws from the same budget.

### Canvas overlay

- **Map bounds** — a white rectangle around the whole 28 × 36 grid, with a
  dashed line marking the paintable area inside it.
- **Reserved rows** — the rows the HUD covers are hatched, washed and labelled
  *NOT PAINTABLE*: rows 0–1 (`SCORE`) and row 35 (`LIVES`). Tiles and zones are
  refused there. Columns are never clipped — the tunnel has to wrap through
  columns 0 and 27. Movable objects are exempt, so scatter targets can still sit
  in those rows; the built-in level parks two of them on row 0.
- **Grid** — guide lines, toggled from the toolbar or with `G`.
- **Tunnel** — cyan boxes with outward arrows on the two tiles that actually
  wrap, amber tint on the slow tiles, and a dashed centre line marking the row. Selecting the tunnel tool lights up the whole row, since that is what
  a click is about to change.
- Red-zone tint, ghost-door outlines, mirror guides.
- Object markers, with a dashed ring around the armed one.
- Hover preview of the exact cells the brush will paint.

Walls, dots and the ghost-house gate are drawn from the level being edited, so
the maze on screen is always the maze you are painting.

### Undo / Redo

Snapshot-based, up to 50 steps; `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` (or `Ctrl+Shift+Z`). One
stroke is one step, and a stroke that changes nothing does not push a step.

## Validation

Click **✔ Validate** to run all checks. Results appear inline in the panel.

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| 1 | Grid must be exactly 36 rows × 28 columns |
| 2 | At least one dot or power pellet must exist |
| 3 | Player spawn must be on a walkable tile (value > 0) |
| 4 | All enemy spawns must be on walkable tiles |
| 5 | Fruit spawn should be on a walkable tile (warning only) |
| 6 | Tunnel row must be in bounds |
| 7 | Slow tiles must not sit on walls, where no enemy can reach them (warning only) |
| 8 | BFS reachability — all dots must be reachable from player spawn (respects tunnel wrapping) |
| 9 | Level name should not be empty (warning only) |
| 10 | Nothing may exceed the current tile set's budget |
| 11 | Ghost door tiles and power pellets should exist (warnings only) |
| 12 | Pellets outside rows 2–34, hidden under the HUD (warning only) |
| 13 | A tile marked as both a red zone and a slow tile (warning only) |
| 14 | Two objects sharing a tile (warning only) |

**▶ Test level** runs the same checks first and refuses to launch on errors.

---

## Play-Testing

**▶ Test Level** validates first, then launches a live game session with the current editor level (1-player keyboard/gamepad). Press **Escape** at any time to return to the editor. Game-over also returns to the editor automatically.

---

## Level Library (Multi-Map)

All maps are stored persistently in `localStorage` under the key `editor_library`.

| Button | Effect |
|---|---|
| **💾 Save to library** | Saves/updates the current level, along with the tile set it was authored under. Re-saving overwrites the same entry (by ID). Requires a non-empty level name. |
| **📂 My maps (n)** | Opens the library browser modal showing all saved levels. |

### Library Modal

Each entry shows:
- **Level name** and last-saved timestamp
- **Dot and power-pellet counts**
- **📂 Load** — loads the level into the editor (pushes undo)
- **▶ Test** — validates and launches a test game directly from the library
- **🗑 Delete** — removes the entry (with confirmation)

---

## Save / Load Files

| Button | Effect |
|---|---|
| **⬇ Export** | Downloads the current level as a `.json` file |
| **⬆ Import** | Opens a file picker to load a `.json` level file into the editor |
| **↺ Reset** | Resets to the built-in Classic level (with confirmation) |

### JSON Format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "My Level",
  "tiles": [[0, 0, ...], ...],
  "playerStart": { "x": 13.5, "y": 26 },
  "enemyStarts": {
    "redEnemy":     { "x": 13.5, "y": 14 },
    "cyanEnemy":    { "x": 12,   "y": 17 },
    "hotpinkEnemy": { "x": 13.5, "y": 17 },
    "orangeEnemy":  { "x": 15,   "y": 17 }
  },
  "fruitSpawn":       { "x": 13, "y": 20 },
  "tunnelRow":        17,
  "tunnelSlowTiles": [
    { "x": 0, "y": 17 }, { "x": 1, "y": 17 }, { "x": 2, "y": 17 },
    { "x": 3, "y": 17 }, { "x": 4, "y": 17 }, { "x": 5, "y": 17 },
    { "x": 22, "y": 17 }, { "x": 23, "y": 17 }, { "x": 24, "y": 17 },
    { "x": 25, "y": 17 }, { "x": 26, "y": 17 }, { "x": 27, "y": 17 }
  ],
  "redZoneTiles": [
    { "x": 12, "y": 14 }, { "x": 15, "y": 14 },
    { "x": 12, "y": 26 }, { "x": 15, "y": 26 }
  ],
  "enemyHouseDoor": { "x": 14, "y": 15 },
  "scatterTargets": {
    "redEnemy":     { "x": 26, "y": 0  },
    "cyanEnemy":    { "x": 27, "y": 34 },
    "hotpinkEnemy": { "x": 2,  "y": 0  },
    "orangeEnemy":  { "x": 0,  "y": 34 }
  }
}
```

`enemyHouseDoor` is derived from the painted ghost-door tiles rather than placed
separately, but it is still written out exactly as before.

`tunnelSlowTiles` replaces the old `tunnelSlowColMax` / `tunnelSlowColMin` pair.
A level file carrying the old fields is converted on load
(`src/editor/LevelMigrate.ts`) into the tiles those bounds covered, so nothing
saved by an earlier version loses its slow zones.

---

## Auto-Save

The editor auto-saves to `localStorage` key `editor_autosave` within 500 ms of any change (debounced). This is separate from the library — it is a single scratch-pad slot that restores the last working state on page reload.

Editor settings (tile set, brush size, mirror mode, grid, half-tile drops) live
separately under `editor_prefs`; they follow the person, not the level.

---

## Panel Layout

The panel is a toolbar, not a long scrolling column. It has three fixed parts
and one that changes:

| Part | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Action bar** (always visible) | Hide · Undo · Redo · Grid · the hover readout |
| **Tab strip** | Paint · Brush · Objects · Zones · Level · More |
| **Tab body** | Only the selected section — sized so it does not scroll |
| **Test level** | Pinned below the body, reachable from every tab |

Undo, redo and Test never move, so they work whichever section is open.
Choosing a tool from the keyboard brings its section forward: `S` opens Zones
with Slow tiles selected, `3` opens Paint with Dot selected.

Controls sit in grids that reflow to the available width — four columns on a
phone in portrait, two in the side panel — instead of one control per row.
Readouts (validation results, budget bars, the shortcut list) take whatever
space is left and scroll on their own if there is not enough; controls never do.

### Docking

| Screen | Dock |
|---|---|
| ≥ 880 px wide | Side panel, 268 px |
| Landscape phone | Side panel — a bottom sheet would be two rows tall |
| Portrait phone | Bottom sheet, `clamp(300px, 50vh, 420px)` |

The canvas is resized and offset to clear whichever dock is in use, re-checked
each frame because mobile browsers do not reliably fire `resize` when the URL
bar slides away. **Hide** (`✕`, or `H`) collapses the panel to a floating ✏
button and gives the maze the full screen.

## Accessibility

- Tap targets are at least 44 px (46 px on touch devices, 40 px only on short
  screens), and inputs are 16 px so iOS does not zoom on focus.
- The tab strip is a `tablist` of `tab` buttons controlling `tabpanel`s;
  controls carry `aria-pressed` / `aria-checked`; the palette and mirror modes
  are `radiogroup`s.
- Validation output and toasts are `aria-live` regions, and focus rings are
  visible throughout.
- Objects can be placed without a pointer: select one, then nudge it with the
  arrow keys.

### Data Flow

```
?editor=true
    ↓
startEditorMode()          ← loads autosave or level1Data
    ↓
editorLoop() [rAF]
    → Draw.level()          ← reads Levels.levelDynamic each frame
    → drawEditorOverlay()   ← grid, spawn markers, tunnel highlight, scatter targets
    ↓
User edits → applyToolDown/Drag → Levels.levelDynamic updated live
    ↓
Save to Library → LevelLibrary.saveLevel()    (localStorage array)
Browse My Maps  → openLibraryModal()          (load / test / delete each entry)
Export          → JSON file download
Import          → JSON file picker → pushUndo → Object.assign(state.level, …)
    ↓
▶ Test Level → validateLevel → startTestGame(level, onReturn)
    → Game runs with custom level (1-player, full game loop)
    → ESC or game-over → onReturn() → editor panel rebuilt, rAF restarted
```

### LevelData Interface (`src/types.ts`)

```typescript
interface LevelData {
    version: number;
    name: string;
    tiles: TileValue[][];           // 36 rows × 28 cols; TileValue = 0|2|3|4|5
    playerStart: { x: number; y: number };
    enemyStarts: {
        redEnemy:     { x: number; y: number };
        cyanEnemy:    { x: number; y: number };
        hotpinkEnemy: { x: number; y: number };
        orangeEnemy:  { x: number; y: number };
    };
    fruitSpawn:       { x: number; y: number };
    tunnelRow:        number;
    tunnelSlowTiles:  { x: number; y: number }[];
    redZoneTiles:     { x: number; y: number }[];
    enemyHouseDoor:   { x: number; y: number };
    scatterTargets: {
        redEnemy:     { x: number; y: number };
        cyanEnemy:    { x: number; y: number };
        hotpinkEnemy: { x: number; y: number };
        orangeEnemy:  { x: number; y: number };
    };
}
```
