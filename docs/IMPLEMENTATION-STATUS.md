| Inky | Doubled vector from Blinky to 2-ahead of Pac-Man (with up-bug) | ⚠️ | Currently uses same logic as Blinky; authentic algorithm in Phase 5 |
| Clyde | Pac-Man if ≥8 tiles away, else scatter corner | ⚠️ | Currently uses same logic as Blinky; authentic algorithm in Phase 5 |
| All — Scatter | Fixed corner target tile | ✅ | `SCATTER_TARGETS` in `AI.ts` — Blinky(26,0) Pinky(2,0) Inky(27,34) Clyde(0,34) |
