|---|---|---|
| 4 ghosts rendered (correct colors) | ✅ | Red, hotpink, cyan, orange |

| Ghost movement (Blinky) | ✅ | `Move.blinky()` + `AI.ghostTileCenter()` |
| Ghost movement (Pinky / Inky / Clyde) | ✅ | `Move.pinky/inky/sue()` — all use same chase-Pac-Man logic for now; authentic personalities in Phase 5 |

## Ghost AI — Individual Targeting

| Ghost | Chase Target | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blinky | Pac-Man's current tile | ✅ | `AI.ghostTileCenter()` uses `pacman.roundedX/Y()` |
| Pinky | 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man (with up-bug) | ⚠️ | Currently uses same logic as Blinky; authentic algorithm in Phase 5 |
| Inky | Doubled vector from Blinky to 2-ahead of Pac-Man (with up-bug) | ⚠️ | Currently uses same logic as Blinky; authentic algorithm in Phase 5 |
| Clyde | Pac-Man if ≥8 tiles away, else scatter corner | ⚠️ | Currently uses same logic as Blinky; authentic algorithm in Phase 5 |
| All — Scatter | Fixed corner target tile | ❌ | |
| All — Frightened | PRNG random wandering | ❌ | |
| All — Eyes | Fixed ghost house return tile | ❌ | |
